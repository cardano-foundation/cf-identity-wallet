# ID Wallet
An open-source Decentralised Identity (DID) and Verifiable Credential (VC) Wallet complying to W3C and DIDComm standards utilising Local-First Software design and development principles.  The wallet also features a bespoke Cardano Crypto Wallet. 

## Deployment steps before building
Our DIDComm over LibP2P implementation currently depends on a locally deployed WebRTC relay.
```
docker compose up -d
```

## Building the app
TODO

## End to end testing
### Pre-installed on local:

- [allure commandline](https://docs.qameta.io/allure-report/#_installing_a_commandline)
- npm and node js
- android emulator for samsung galaxy s23 ultra is configured or ios simulator for iphone 15 pro / 15 pro max
- add .env to root folder with APP_PATH property with path to app build for chosen platform e.g.

# iOS
APP_PATH=<LOCAL_PATH/App.app>
```
### Test run in local:

1. Install all packages locally
