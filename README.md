# Overview

<div align="justify"> 
<b> The Identity Wallet is an open source application developed by the Cardano Foundation. This project is the result of ongoing research and development pertaining to the principles of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI), Self-Certifying Identifiers (SCIs), Verifiable Data Registries (VDRs), and the standards, frameworks, and implementations available within the Cardano ecosystem and externally. The first release of Identity Wallet provides an open source reference implementation demonstrating the Key Event Receipt Infrastructure (KERI) on Cardano. </b>

# Getting Started

## Requirements
- Node.js: Version 18.20.4.
- npm: Compatible with the Node.js version.
- Xcode: For iOS emulation (latest version recommended).
- Android Studio: For Android emulation (latest version recommended).
- Capacitor: Version 6.0.0 (refer to package.json). For detailed environment setup, refer to the [Capacitor Environment Setup Guide](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/getting-started/environment-setup).
- Mobile Device: iOS or Android for running the app on physical devices.
- Docker, Docker Compose.

Ensure that your system meets these requirements to successfully use and develop the Identity Wallet application.

### Cloning the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-identity-wallet.git
cd cf-identity-wallet
make init # This will configure the git hooks
```

## Preparing the App
This project uses a specific node version (check the requirements section above). You can optionally use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage and switch between different Node.js versions on your computer.

Before running the App, ensure that all dependencies are installed and the app is built properly. 
In the project root directory, run the following commands:
```bash
npm install
```
## Running in the Browser
The development server depends on a local KERIA and credential issuance server setup.
The [Docker Compose](./docker-compose.yaml) file can be used to quickly bring these services up.

```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
npm run dev
```
This command starts the development server and allows you to preview the application on your browser by opening this localhost address:

[http://localhost:3003/](http://localhost:3003/)

## Running in an Emulator
You can discover how to run the application in an emulator by following this [link](docs/Running-in-an-Emulator.md).

## End-to-End (E2E) Testing
You can gain additional insights into end-to-end testing by visiting the provided [link](docs/Testing.md).

# Troubleshooting
<div align="justify"> 
Please be aware that from time-to-time the hosted pre-production KERI services require restarting.  When this occurs it causes a white-screen when launching the application.  If you experience the white-screen issue please wait for the services to restart and the application will load as expected.   If you have any questions, there is also a Discord Channel available for the Identity Wallet.
