- Node.js and npm
- Appium installed locally (in case if @wdio/appium-service will not work as expected)
  - install appium e.g. ``` brew install appium ```
  - install driver for ios ``` appium driver install xcuitest ```
  - install driver for android ``` appium driver install uiautomator2 ```
  - install driver for chrome ``` appium driver install chromium ```
  - install driver for safari ``` appium driver install safari ```
- Android Emulator for [Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra](https://developer.samsung.com/galaxy-emulator-skin/guide.html) is configured or iOS Simulator for [iPhone 15 Pro / 15 Pro Max](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/installing-additional-simulator-runtimes)
- Create .env file in your local root project folder with APP_PATH property with path to app build for chosen platform
```
# Android
# APP_PATH=<LOCAL_PATH/app-release-unsigned.apk>

# iOS

```
### Test run in Local:

1. Install all packages locally

npm run wdio:android:s23ultra
```
or
```
npm run wdio:ios:15promax
```
- for specific feature
```
npm run wdio:ios:15promax -- --spec ./tests/features/passcode.feature
```
- for specific scenario in feature you want to run it put a line number at which there is scenario title
```
npm run wdio:ios:15promax -- --spec ./tests/features/passcode.feature:18
```
- If there are issues with appium service run by WDIO, please start appium in terminal separately
- In case WDIO tests will not exit on its own kill the process yourself e.g. ``` pkill -9 -f wdio ```
